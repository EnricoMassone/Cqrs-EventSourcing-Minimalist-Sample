# Cqrs Event Sourcing sample application
This is a minimalistic application implemented by using a CQRS Event Sourcing architecture. 
I implemented this application for fun, in order to showcase a possible CQRS Event Sourcing implementation with `C#` and `.NET core`.

The business domain of this sample is inspired by Greg Young's [simple CQRS application](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r). 
The solution organization is inspired by Jason Taylor's [clean architecture template](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture). 
I learned many of the techniques showcased by this sample application by reading [Hands-On Domain-Driven Design with .NET Core book](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-domain-driven-design-with-net-core/9781788834094)
